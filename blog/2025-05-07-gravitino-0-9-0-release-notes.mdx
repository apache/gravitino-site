Gravitino 0.9.0 focused more on AI, data government, and security. Many features are used in the production environment. The community received much feedback from users in many well-known companies. The AI and security features have raised more and more attention.
In this version, the community optimizes the user experience regarding fileset catalogs and model catalogs. This allows users to manage their unstructured AI data and model data more conveniently.

Talking about data lineage, the community added a data lineage interface. Users can implement their custom data lineage plugin to adapt to their system.
For security, the community corrects some privilege semantics and fixes many authorization plugin corner cases to make the system more robust.

## Model Catalog

Before 0.9.0, the model catalog was immutable, which was not convenient. It can alter models and model versions, and supports adding tags in the new version [#6626](https://github.com/apache/gravitino/issues/6226) [#6222](https://github.com/apache/gravitino/issues/6222).

## Fileset Catalog

Gravitino now supports multiple named storage locations within a single fileset and placeholder-based path generation.

With multiple locations support, users can reference data across different file systems (HDFS, S3, GCS, local, etc.) through a unified fileset interface, each with a unique location name.

The placeholder feature allows dynamic storage path generation using the `{{placeholder}}` syntax, where placeholders are automatically replaced with corresponding fileset properties.

These enhancements significantly improve flexibility for multi-cloud environments and complex data organization patterns while maintaining a clean abstraction layer for data assets management [#6681](https://github.com/apache/gravitino/issues/6681).

## GVFS (Gravitino Virtual File System)

GVFS has been enhanced to support accessing multiple locations within filesets.Users can now select which location to use through configuration properties, environment variables, or fileset default settings.

GVFS has also been refactored with a pluggable architecture allowing custom operations and hooks, enabling users to extend functionality through `operations_class` and `hook_class` configuration options for more flexible integration with their specific infrastructure [#6938](https://github.com/apache/gravitino/issues/6938).

## Security

The new version added privileges for the model and corrected some privilege semantics.
Meanwhile, it fixed some bugs with the Ranger path-based plugin [#6620](https://github.com/apache/gravitino/pull/6620) [#6575](https://github.com/apache/gravitino/pull/6575) [#6821](https://github.com/apache/gravitino/pull/6821) [#6864](https://github.com/apache/gravitino/pull/6864).
All of the user-related,  group-related, and role-related events were supported for the event system [#2969](https://github.com/apache/gravitino/issues/2969) .

## Data Lineage

The community added a data lineage interface that follows the OpenLineage API spec. Users can implement their custom data lineage plugin to adapt to their system [#6617](https://github.com/apache/gravitino/issues/6617).

## Core

The community mainly cared about the performance. It improves the performance by reducing the scope of the lock and batch reading data from storage [#6744](https://github.com/apache/gravitino/issues/6744) [#6560](https://github.com/apache/gravitino/issues/6560) [#2870](https://github.com/apache/gravitino/issues/2780) .

## CLI

Additionally, there is one more change worth mentioning: users no longer need to rely on the alias command to use the CLI. Instead,  the community provided a convenient script located at ./bin/gcli.sh that the user can directly use the CLI client [#5383](https://github.com/apache/gravitino/issues/5383).

## Connector

Both Flink connector and Spark connector add JDBC support [#6233](https://github.com/apache/gravitino/issues/6233) [#6164](https://github.com/apache/gravitino/issues/6164).

## Chart

Deploy Gravitino on Kubernetes with fully customizable configurations [#6594](https://github.com/apache/gravitino/issues/6594).

## Overall

Gravitino 0.9.0 focused more on AI, data government, and security. We thank the Gravitino community for their continued support and valuable contributions. Thanks to our users' feedback, we can continue to innovate and build,
So thanks to all those reading this!
