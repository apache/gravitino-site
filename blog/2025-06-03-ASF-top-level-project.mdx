We’re excited to share that **Apache Gravitino** is now a **Top-Level Project (TLP)** at the Apache Software Foundation (ASF)\! This milestone marks a major step forward for the project and the community that’s grown around it since entering the Apache Incubator in June 2024\.

Gravitino was created to solve a growing pain in today’s data ecosystem: managing metadata across an explosion of systems including data warehouses, datalakes, lakehouses, streaming platforms, and AI tools. With Gravitino, you get a high-performance, open-source metastore that brings all that metadata together into one unified platform. Think of it as the missing layer that makes your data and AI assets easier to manage, discover, and govern.

“Graduation is a major milestone for any Apache project,” said **Justin Mclean, Chair of the Apache Incubator**. “Apache Gravitino has demonstrated the maturity expected of a top-level project, including a diverse and engaged community and a deep understanding of the ASF’s governance principles."

## **Built for Today’s Data Stack**

Gravitino supports a wide range of systems out of the box, including **Apache Iceberg**, **Apache Hive**, **Apache Kafka**, **MySQL**, **PostgreSQL**, and more. Whether you're building a modern lakehouse architecture or trying to wrangle metadata across hybrid cloud and on-prem environments, Gravitino helps break down data silos and streamline metadata governance at scale.

“We’re thrilled to see Gravitino become an Apache Top-Level Project,” said **Jerry Shao, Chair of Apache Gravitino**. “Our community is deeply committed to building a scalable, extensible metadata system that helps enterprises unify their data ecosystem. Graduation is not the end but a new beginning and we’re just getting started.”

## **Growing Community, Real-World Adoption**

In under a year, Gravitino has built a global community of contributors and gained real adoption from companies with serious data challenges. 

“As organizations grapple with increasingly complex and distributed data and AI environments, Gravitino provides the unified metadata layer that’s been missing,” said **Junping Du**, **CEO of Datastrato**. “We’re proud to support the project and congratulate the community on this big step forward.”

"Gravitino is uniquely designed to bridge data and AI workloads. We're excited to deploy it across our multi-cloud AI clusters and contribute to many prioritized AI and agent-based use cases," said **Jack Song**, **Director of Uber Data Platform**. "Gravitino’s graduation marks its maturity entering the next level, backed by a thriving and engaged community."

“As the first open-source Iceberg REST Catalog, Apache Gravitino has been running in our production environment for quite some time,” said **Ang Zhang**, **Director of Big Data Platform at Pinterest**. “Gravitino’s graduation to an ASF Top-Level Project marks an important milestone—it reflects the project's maturity, the strength of its community, and its growing reliability for broader production use.”
