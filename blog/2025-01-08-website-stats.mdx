Like many ASF projects, Apache Gravitino uses [https://matomo.org](Matomo), a privacy-friendly alternative to Google Analytics, to collect visitor traffic data for its website. Here are some highlights from the last six months of 2024:

- **Total visits:** Nearly 45,000  
- **Top country:** The United States, with 77% of our traffic. Visitors came from every U.S. state except Montana, North Dakota, and Kansas.  
- **Geographical reach:** Visitors came from 103 different countries.  
- **Top European country:** The Netherlands  
- **Popular content:** Our GitHub README tops the list, followed by the overview and getting started pages.
