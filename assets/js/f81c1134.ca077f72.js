Many of its new features are already being used in production environments. The release has attracted strong interest from users from well-known companies, with AI and security capabilities drawing attention.\\n\\nIn this version, the community optimized the user experience for fileset catalogs and model catalogs, making it easier for users to manage their unstructured AI data and model data.\\n\\nThe community added a new data lineage interface. Users can now implement a custom data lineage plugin to adapt to their own system.\\n\\nFor security, the community has corrected some privilege semantics and fixed authorization plugin corner cases to make the entire system more robust.\\n\\n## Model Catalog\\n\\nBefore 0.9.0, the model catalog was immutable, which was not flexible. In the new version, users can alter models and model versions and add tags [#6626](https://github.com/apache/gravitino/issues/6226) [#6222](https://github.com/apache/gravitino/issues/6222).\\n\\n## Fileset Catalog\\n\\nGravitino now supports multiple named storage locations within a single fileset and placeholder-based path generation.\\n\\nWith multiple location support, users can reference data across different file systems (HDFS, S3, GCS, local, etc.) through a unified fileset interface, each with a unique location name.\\n\\nThe placeholder feature allows dynamic storage path generation using the `{{placeholder}}` syntax, automatically replacing placeholders with corresponding fileset properties.\\n\\nThese enhancements significantly improves the flexibility for multi-cloud environments and complex data organization patterns while maintaining a clean abstraction layer for data assets management [#6681](https://github.com/apache/gravitino/issues/6681).\\n\\n## GVFS (Gravitino Virtual File System)\\n\\nGVFS has been enhanced to support accessing multiple locations within filesets. Users can now select which location to use through configuration properties, environment variables, or fileset default settings.\\n\\nGVFS has also been refactored with a pluggable architecture allowing custom operations and hooks. This enables users to extend functionality through `operations_class` and `hook_class` configuration options for more flexible integration with their specific infrastructure [#6938](https://github.com/apache/gravitino/issues/6938).\\n\\n## Security\\n\\nThe new version has added privileges for the data model and corrected some privilege semantics.\\nIt has also fixed some bugs with the Ranger path-based plugin [#6620](https://github.com/apache/gravitino/pull/6620) [#6575](https://github.com/apache/gravitino/pull/6575) [#6821](https://github.com/apache/gravitino/pull/6821) [#6864](https://github.com/apache/gravitino/pull/6864).\\nAll of the user-related,  group-related, and role-related events are now supported for the event system [#2969](https://github.com/apache/gravitino/issues/2969).\\n\\n## Data Lineage\\n\\nThe community added a data lineage interface that follows the OpenLineage API specification. Users can implement their custom data lineage plugin to adapt to their system [#6617](https://github.com/apache/gravitino/issues/6617).\\n\\n## Core\\n\\nThe community cared about performance. Performance was improved by reducing the scope of the lock and batch reading data from storage [#6744](https://github.com/apache/gravitino/issues/6744) [#6560](https://github.com/apache/gravitino/issues/6560) [#2870](https://github.com/apache/gravitino/issues/2780).\\n\\n## CLI\\n\\nAdditionally, there is one more change worth mentioning. Users no longer need to rely on the alias command to use the CLI. Instead, the community provided a convenient script located at ./bin/gcli.sh so that a user can directly use the CLI client [#5383](https://github.com/apache/gravitino/issues/5383).\\n\\n## Connector\\n\\nBoth the Flink connector and the Spark connector added JDBC support [#6233](https://github.com/apache/gravitino/issues/6233) [#6164](https://github.com/apache/gravitino/issues/6164).\\n\\n## Chart\\n\\nDeploying Gravitino on Kubernetes with a fully customizable configuration [#6594](https://github.com/apache/gravitino/issues/6594).\\n\\n## Overall\\n\\nGravitino 0.9.0 focuses on advancements in AI, data governance, and security.

In this release, the community provides several exciting features like model catalog, Fuse for Fileset, credential vending for Fileset, Flink Iceberg and Paimon connector, Spark Paimon connector, and security enforcement.\\n\\nThis release blog will briefly introduce the new significant features and improvements. Please keep reading to learn more about what the community has worked on.\\n\\n## Model Catalog\\n\\nBesides table and messaging metadata, Gravitino supports model metadata management in version 0.8. Gravitino allows a model to have multiple versions, and users can choose the best version. 0.8 provides basic functionality, and more features will be provided in the future, such as tagging models and better integration with machine learning workflows, to help users better manage models and extract more value from data and models.\\n\\n* Support model versioning metadata [#4783](https://github.com/apache/gravitino/issues/4783).\\n\\n## Credential vending\\n\\nCredential vending is a fundamental function in the cloud. In version 0.7, credential vending was supported for the Iceberg REST server. In version 0.8, we offer support for the Gravitino server and integrate it with Fileset. Based on Credential vending, Fileset can be used more securely and conveniently. The Gravitino server will centrally manage the security key and issue a temporary token, which is only valid for the Fileset that needs to be accessed by the request, making it more secure and eliminating the need for the user side to provide information such as AKSK.\\n\\nIn addition to the support for GCS and S3, version 0.8 also has built-in support for OSS and ADLS credential vending, and can support other storage in a pluggable manner.\\n\\n* Support credential vending for fileset client [#5677](https://github.com/apache/gravitino/issues/5677).\\n* Support credential vending for Gravitino [#4398](https://github.com/apache/gravitino/issues/4398).\\n* Support Aliyun OSS credential provider [#5625](https://github.com/apache/gravitino/issues/5625).\\n* Support ADLS credential provider [#5624](https://github.com/apache/gravitino/issues/5624).\\n\\n## Fuse for Fileset\\n\\nWith the widespread use of Fileset in AI scenarios, how to improve usability and reduce user usage costs has become a major issue. In AI scenarios, users tend to access remote data in the way of local disks. Fuse for fileset is designed based on this, enabling users to access data managed by Fileset as if they were using local disks. Currently, basic alpha functionality is provided, which allows access to S3 data managed by Fileset. In subsequent versions, metadata caching functionality and support for more storage will be provided. Fuse for fileset is developed in Rust for performance considerations, and everyone is welcome to join the development.\\n\\n* Implement GVFS fuse to access Gravitino fileset in the POSIX Protocol [#5504](https://github.com/apache/gravitino/issues/5504).\\n\\n## Lakehouse Federation\\n\\nGravitino provides a variety of catalogs, such as Apache Hive, Apache Iceberg, Apache Hudi, and Apache Paimon, etc. How can it be better connected to the surrounding ecosystem to facilitate user use? This iteration provides Flink Paimon connector, Flink Iceberg connector, and Spark Paimon connector to access data from Paimon and Iceberg. More connectors will be supported in the future. Let\'s look forward to it.\\n\\n* Support Iceberg catalog in Flink connector [#3515](https://github.com/apache/gravitino/issues/3515).\\n* Support Paimon catalog in Flink connector [#5194](https://github.com/apache/gravitino/issues/5194) [#5193](https://github.com/apache/gravitino/issues/5193) [#5192](https://github.com/apache/gravitino/issues/5192).\\n* Support Paimon catalog in Spark connector [#5722](https://github.com/apache/gravitino/pull/5722).\\n\\n## Security enforcement\\n\\nAs a metadata management system, security is of the utmost importance. In this iteration, we managing security policies in chain authorization, and support the push-down of SQL security policies and path-based security policies. Additionally, the privilege policies of Iceberg and Paimon tables can be pushed down to Ranger. Based on Gravitino\'s security policies, a solid foundation is provided for your business development.\\n\\n* Chain authorization multiple underlying data source [#5774](https://github.com/apache/gravitino/issues/5774).\\n* SQL based  authorization plugin  [#5530](https://github.com/apache/gravitino/issues/5530).\\n* Add path-based authorization securable object and user-group mapping interface [#5966](https://github.com/apache/gravitino/issues/5966).\\n* Use chain authorization to support Hive and HDFS authorization [#5956](https://github.com/apache/gravitino/issues/5956).\\n* Ranger Authorization HDFS Plugin [#5731](https://github.com/apache/gravitino/issues/5731).\\n\\n## Other notable enhancements\\n\\n### Iceberg REST server\\n\\n* Generate credential according to the data path and metadata path [#5648](https://github.com/apache/gravitino/issues/5648).\\n* Integrate audit log framework for Iceberg REST server [#5556](https://github.com/apache/gravitino/issues/5556).\\n* Add schema and view event for Iceberg REST server [#5438](https://github.com/apache/gravitino/issues/5438) [#5437](https://github.com/apache/gravitino/issues/5437).\\nAdd HTTP header to Iceberg event [#5518](https://github.com/apache/gravitino/issues/5518).\\n\\n### Core\\n\\n* Optimization tree lock when drop and load Table/Schema  [#6044](https://github.com/apache/gravitino/issues/6044).\\n* Support ADLS storage for Gravitino Iceberg catalog and Spark connector [#5954](https://github.com/apache/gravitino/issues/5954).\\n* Support pre-event for Gravitino server [#5317](https://github.com/apache/gravitino/issues/5317).\\n\\n### Gravitino Client\\n\\n* Add CLI interface for Gravitino [#4943](https://github.com/apache/gravitino/issues/4943).\\n* Support Python client for table operations [#5198](https://github.com/apache/gravitino/issues/5198).\\n\\n## BUG FIX\\n\\nVersion 0.8 has fixed a large number of bugs, especially in terms of security and fileset usage. Some are listed below.\\n\\n* Can\'t load filesystem \'gs\' when use spark to access Gravitino GCS bundles [#5609](https://github.com/apache/gravitino/issues/5609).\\n* Invalid token issue happened in GVFS when Spark job long running [#5596](https://github.com/apache/gravitino/issues/5596).\\n* Trino, hive catalog: COMMNET COLUMN with \' \' or NULL has ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException error, [#5533](https://github.com/apache/gravitino/issues/5533).\\n* Correct the behaviors when creating Iceberg table with none distribution [#6196](https://github.com/apache/gravitino/issues/6196)\\n* Updable to create fileset with minio [#6156](https://github.com/apache/gravitino/issues/6156).\\n* Grant privileges to a role, duplicated privilege name with different condition shouldn\u2019t be allowed to grant [#6116](https://github.com/apache/gravitino/issues/6116).\\n* The owner of the catalog is incorrect when using Basic Auth and Password is empty [#5968](https://github.com/apache/gravitino/issues/5968).\\n* Grant a metalake level privilege won\'t take effect [#5892](https://github.com/apache/gravitino/issues/5892).\\n\\n## Overall\\n\\nApache Gravitino 0.8.0 is the third ASF release. This version adds a bunch of new features. We thank the Gravitino community for their continued support and valuable contributions.

In this release, the community\\nmainly focused on strengthening cloud support to make Gravitino work better in cloud environments.\\n\\nThis release blog will briefly introduce the new features related to cloud support and other\\nsignificant features and improvements. Please keep reading to learn more about what the community has worked on.\\n\\n## Cloud storage support for Gravitino\\n\\nAs more and more users run their data stacks in the cloud and use cloud object storage, cloud\\nstorage support has become an imperative requirement. In this release, the community has mainly focused on\\nadding cloud storage support for Gravitino to make sure Gravitino itself and its connectors/sources\\ncan work smoothly with cloud storage.\\n\\nIn this release:\\n\\n* Gravitino Iceberg REST catalog server now supports different cloud storage services, including AWS S3,\\n  Google GCS, Aliyun OSS. Users can simply configure it to make it work.\\n* Gravitino Fileset catalog now supports managing files (objects) stored in S3, GCS, and OSS.\\n  Gravitino provides both server-side pluggable framework and client-side Java / Python GVFS\\n  (Gravitino Virtual File System) SDK. Users can easily use their existing tools with the\\n  Gravitino provided bundled packages to access the data in the cloud. Also,\\n  Gravitino provides a pluggable framework for users to implement their own storage support.\\n* Gravitino\u2019s Hive, Paimon, and Iceberg catalogs also adds and verifies the support with\\n  different cloud storage.\\n* Gravitino\u2019s Spark and Trino connectors also verifies cloud storage support.\\n\\nOverall, with the 0.7.0 release, Gravitino generally supports working with different cloud storage services.\\nTo know more, you can check our issue [#4396](https://github.com/apache/gravitino/issues/4396). Also,\\nwe\u2019re continuing to add more cloud storage support in future releases. Please stay tuned.\\n\\n## Credential vending support in Gravitino\\n\\nBesides cloud storage support, credential vending support is also vital for Gravitino,\\nespecially to work with cloud storage. The traditional way of using AKSK is not convenient or safe.\\nWith credential vending technology, the Gravitino server will help users get temporary tokens for\\nauthentication, significantly simplifying the client-side configurations and centralizing authentications.\\n\\nGravitino 0.7.0 introduces a framework to support Credential vending and also adds S3 and GCS\\ntoken support. This framework is integrated into Gravitino\'s Iceberg REST catalog service. So\\nusers can smoothly access Iceberg tables on S3 and GCS with authentication.\\n\\nThis is just the first step of credential vending, and we will add more integrations with Gravitino,\\nlike fileset support, connector support, etc, in the next release.\\n\\nFor the details of credential vending, please check the issue [#4398](https://github.com/apache/gravitino/issues/4398)\\nand the [design document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fovK0ylSmI45ynrCPcnRZqzyPDn7DRNb_ExdbjVPq0k/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.1cts6muko2j1).\\n\\n## Unified access control improvements\\n\\nGravitino 0.6.0 introduced the alpha version of unified access control with Apache Ranger\\nsupport ([here](https://gravitino.apache.org/blog/gravitino-0-6-0-release-notes#introducing-the-unified-rbac-model-for-gravitino)),\\nbut this feature still needs improvement. In version 0.7.0, we added many improvements and bug fixes to make this end-to-end access control workable. Now, with the release of\\n0.7.0, the Gravitino unified access control works well with Spark and Ranger to secure end-to-end table access. To see what we have fixed, please check out our issue [#4615](https://github.com/apache/gravitino/issues/4615).\\nYou can also try our [playground](https://github.com/apache/gravitino-playground) to try out the\\nunified access control feature.\\n\\n## Centralized audit log support\\n\\nThanks to the community, Gravitino now supports centralized audit logs. With this feature enabled,\\nusers can get the audit information in a centralized place, whether they\u2019re accessing tables or filesets from various sources.\\n\\nGravitino\u2019s audit log framework also supports different plugin formatters and writers, and users\\ncan implement their own log format and output destinations.\\n\\nPlease see the issues [#4887](https://github.com/apache/gravitino/issues/4887)\\nand [#4021](https://github.com/apache/gravitino/issues/4021) to know more about Gravitino\u2019s\\ncentralized audit log.\\n\\n## New data sources support\\n\\nAs a unified data catalog, the community always aims to add more data sources. In\\nthis version, Gravitino adds two new data sources. One is [Apache Hudi](https://hudi.apache.org/),\\nthe other is [OceanBase](https://github.com/oceanbase/oceanbase). You can now use Gravitino to\\nmanipulate Hudi and Oceanbase metadata in a unified manner.\\n\\n## Various core features\\n\\nApart from the features listed above, this version also improves a lot at its core, here are several important features:\\n\\n* Add PostgreSQL support for storage backend [#4101](https://github.com/apache/gravitino/issues/4101).\\n  Gravitino already supports using MySQL, H2 as its backend metadata storage. In 0.7.0, the\\n  community adds the PostgreSQL support to enlarge its adoption.\\n* Unify the catalog and metalake drop behavior [#5031](https://github.com/apache/gravitino/issues/5031).\\n  In the previous version, we didn\u2019t enforce the behavior of catalog and metadata drop operations.\\n  In this version, we redefine its behavior and make it much safer.\\n* Manage columns in Gravitino [#4493](https://github.com/apache/gravitino/issues/4493).\\n  In 0.7.0, we introduce the column entity in Gravitino, which Gravitino can manage.\\n  With this feature introduced, Gravitino can now support tagging on columns, and in future, it\\n  will support column-level operations.\\n* Add an event listener for Iceberg REST catalog server [#5204](https://github.com/apache/gravitino/issues/5204)\\n  and support pre-event for event listener [#5112](https://github.com/apache/gravitino/issues/5112).\\n\\n## Other notable enhancements\\n\\n### Gravitino core\\n\\n* Supporting storing column metadata in Gravitino [#4493](https://github.com/apache/gravitino/issues/4493).\\n* Support pre-event for Gravitino [#5049](https://github.com/apache/gravitino/issues/5049).\\n* Unify drop metalake and catalog behavior [#5031](https://github.com/apache/gravitino/issues/5031).\\n* Add credential vending support in Gravitino [#4398](https://github.com/apache/gravitino/issues/4398).\\n* Support audit log in Gravitino [#4887](https://github.com/apache/gravitino/issues/4887).\\n* Shrink the package size of Gravitino [#4513](https://github.com/apache/gravitino/issues/4513).\\n\\n### Iceberg REST catalog server\\n\\n* Add credential vending for Iceberg REST server.

This release introduces a\\nrole-based access control (RBAC) model in Gravitino to authorize different securable objects in a\\nunified manner.\\n\\nWe use `Privilege`, `SecurableObject`, `Role`, `User`, and `Group` to define the permissions.\\n\\n![RBAC model](./assets/rbac-img1.png)\\n\\n**Privilege**\\n\\nPrivilege defines the types of operations on different metadata objects, and is used to allow or\\ndeny a specific type of operation on a metadata object.\\n\\n**SecurableObject**\\n\\nSecurableObject binds multiple operation-specific types of privileges to a single metadata object.\\n\\n**Role**\\n\\nA Role is a collection of SecurableObjects, and a role represents multiple operation type\\npermissions on multiple metadata objects.\\n\\n**User**\\nUsers are granted one or multiple roles, and users have different operating privileges depending \\non their roles.\\n\\n**Group**\\n\\nTo make it easier to grant a single permission to multiple users, we can add users to a group,\\nand then grant one or more roles to that user group. This process allows all users belonging to\\nthat user group to have the permissions in those roles.\\n\\nMore importantly, the privileges authorized by the user in Gravitino will be pushed down to\\nthe underlying permission system. Currently, we support push permissions to Apache Ranger,\\nothers like IAM are under development.\\n\\n![Authorization flow](./assets/rbac-img2.png)\\n\\nFor more information about how our RBAC works, please check out our [design document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11MF1PTN5UTKJf3WLuHqhCikQzJoLxaXM_AEDZpXhO2I/edit?usp=sharing).\\nTo enable and use access control in Gravitino, please refer to the [user document](https://gravitino.apache.org/docs/0.6.0-incubating/security/access-control).\\n\\nOur implementation of unified access control capability is still in the alpha stage, and we\u2019re\\nstriving to add more features and make it stable as soon as possible, so please stay tuned.\\n\\n## Separation of the Iceberg REST catalog service\\n\\nApache Iceberg is a first-class citizen, and Gravitino has provided an embedded Iceberg REST catalog\\nservice since version 0.3. We have seen the increased demands and adoption of Iceberg REST catalog\\nservice as a standalone server. So, in version 0.6.0, we refactored the whole architecture and\\nmodularized the Iceberg REST catalog service as a standalone service, allowing it to be deployed\\nwith or without the Gravitino server. Besides the refactoring, we also bumped the supported version\\nto Iceberg 1.5.2, added support for S3 cloud storage, and now support the `registerTable` interface.\\n\\nIceberg REST catalog support is crucial to Gravitino, and modularization is just the first step.\\nIn future releases, we will add more features like cloud storage support and integrating Gravitino\u2019s\\nRBAC model, credential vending, etc.\\n\\nTo use the Gravitino Iceberg REST catalog service, please check our [user document](https://gravitino.apache.org/docs/0.6.0-incubating/iceberg-rest-service).\\nThe umbrella issue is [#4058](https://github.com/apache/gravitino/issues/4058).\\n\\n## Tagging support\\n\\nTagging on metadata objects is useful for data discovery, classification, and data governance.\\nIt can also be leveraged by query engines to provide tag-based access control. In Gravitino 0.6.0,\\nwe introduce tag support users can add tags on metadata objects like `CATALOG`, `SCHEMA`, `TABLE`,\\n`FILESET`, and `TOPIC`. To know how our tag system is designed, please check out the \\n[design document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zkQWla8OMIPY61HqKUivpf43cTteNvcd2w_oA32yAfg/edit#heading=h.26ac49mb3u1q)\\nand issue [#3344](https://github.com/apache/gravitino/issues/3344). To use \\ntags in both REST API and Java SDK, please see [how to manage tags](https://gravitino.apache.org/docs/0.6.0-incubating/manage-tags-in-gravitino).\\n\\n## Apache Flink Gravitino connector\\n\\nAs an open data catalog, we want to be able to support all query engines. Therefore, alongside Trino\\nand Apache Spark, we have added Apache Flink as our newest supported query engine.\\n\\nIn 0.6.0, we added a new Flink Gravitino connector [#1354](https://github.com/apache/gravitino/issues/1354)\\nand supported querying Hive tables using Flink with Gravitino. Hive support is just our first step,\\nwe will continue to add more table support.\\n\\nTo know how to use the Flink Gravitino connector, please refer to our [documentation](https://gravitino.apache.org/docs/0.6.0-incubating/flink-connector/flink-connector).\\n\\n## Apache Paimon table management in Gravitino\\n\\nApache Paimon has become quite popular this year, and many companies use Paimon to build their\\nstreaming warehouse or lakehouse. To manage all the lakehouse tables in a unified manner, Gravitino\\nhas added Paimon table management in 0.6.0 [#1129](https://github.com/apache/gravitino/issues/1129).\\nUsers can use our unified API to manage Paimon tables as well as other tables.\\nTo know more about how to manage Paimon tables, please refer to [Lakehouse Paimon Catalog document](https://gravitino.apache.org/docs/0.6.0-incubating/lakehouse-paimon-catalog).\\n\\n## Add Python GVFS support for fileset\\n\\nIn Gravitino 0.5, we added a Java Hadoop Compatible Filesystem (HCFS) support (GVFS) for fileset\\nread/write in Gravitino. The provided Java GVFS can be used by query engines like Apache Spark to\\nread/write data from files or folders. Although this works well in big data, AI development is\\nlargely dominated by Python, which can create an obstacle and hinder users from using Fileset with AI frameworks.\\n\\nIn 0.6.0, we followed the Python fsspec to provide a Python GVFS package that can be used by popular\\nPython frameworks like Apache Arrow, Pandas, Ray, LlamaIndex, and more. You can check \\nout [Python GVFS document](https://gravitino.apache.org/docs/0.6.0-incubating/how-to-use-gvfs#2-managing-files-of-fileset-with-python-gvfs) for more information.\\n\\n## Notable enhancements\\n\\n### Gravitino core\\n\\n* Support catalog reload after a property is altered [#2267](https://github.com/apache/gravitino/issues/2267).\\n* Deprecate KV store and add H2 support as embedded storage backend [#3968](https://github.com/apache/gravitino/issues/3968).\\n\\n### Catalog relate\\n\\n* Add API test catalog connection [#4107](https://github.com/apache/gravitino/issues/4107). \\n* Improve the type system to support unknown types [#3427](https://github.com/apache/gravitino/issues/3427). \\n* Add Kerberos support for fileset Hadoop catalog [#3462](https://github.com/apache/gravitino/issues/3462). \\n* Add S3 support for Iceberg [#4264](https://github.com/apache/gravitino/issues/4264). \\n* Support cloud and region property when creating catalog [#3966](https://github.com/apache/gravitino/issues/3966). \\n* Support multiple Kerberos authentication for Hive catalog [#3906](https://github.com/apache/gravitino/issues/3906). \\n* Unify the behavior of purge for all the catalogs [#3685](https://github.com/apache/gravitino/issues/3685).\\n\\n### API and client\\n\\n* Refactor Java and Python API for better user experience [#3626](https://github.com/apache/gravitino/issues/3626).\\n* Add missing error handlers in Python client [#4225](https://github.com/apache/gravitino/issues/4225).\\n\\nAll the resolved issues targeting the 0.6.0 release can be seen at https://github.com/apache/gravitino/issues?page=12&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+label%3A0.6.0.\\n\\n## Overall\\n\\nApache Gravitino 0.6.0 is the first ASF release, we would like to show appreciation to the Gravitino\\ncommunity for their continued support and valuable contributions.
