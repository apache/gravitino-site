In this release, the community\\nmainly focuses on strengthening cloud support, to make Gravitino work better in the cloud environment.\\n\\nThis release blog will briefly introduce the new features related to cloud support, as well as other\\nsignificant features and improvements. Please keep reading to learn more about what the community has worked on.\\n\\n## Cloud storage support for Gravitino\\n\\nAs more and more users run their data stacks on the cloud and use cloud object storage, cloud\\nstorage support becomes an imperative requirement. In this release, the community mainly focuses on\\nadding cloud storage support for Gravitino and makes sure Gravitino itself and its connectors/sources\\ncan work smoothly with cloud storage.\\n\\nIn this release:\\n\\n* Gravitino Iceberg REST catalog server now supports different cloud storages, including AWS S3,\\n  Google GCS, Aliyun OSS. Users can simply configure it to make it work.\\n* Gravitino Fileset catalog now supports managing files (objects) stored in S3, GCS, and OSS.\\n  Gravitino provides both server-side pluggable framework and client-side Java / Python GVFS\\n  (Gravitino Virtual File System) SDK. Users can easily use their existing tools with the\\n  Gravitino provided bundled packages to access the data in the cloud storage. Besides,\\n  Gravitino also provides a pluggable framework for users to implement their own storage support.\\n* Gravitino\u2019s Hive, Paimon, and Iceberg catalogs also adds and verifies the support with\\n  different cloud storage in this release.\\n* Gravitino\u2019s Spark, Trino connector also verifies to work with cloud storage.\\n\\nOverall, with 0.7.0 release Gravitino could generally support working with different cloud storages.\\nYou can check our issue [#4396](https://github.com/apache/gravitino/issues/4396) to know more. Also,\\nwe\u2019re continuing to add more cloud storage support in the following releases, please stay tuned.\\n\\n## Credential vending support in Gravitino\\n\\nBesides the cloud storage support, credential vending support is also important for Gravitino,\\nespecially to work with cloud storage. The traditional way of using AKSK is not convenient and safe,\\nwith credential vending technology, Gravitino server will help users to get the temporary tokens for\\nauthentication, which will significantly simplify the client side configurations and centralized the\\nauthentications.\\n\\nIn Gravitino 0.7.0, we introduce a framework to support Credential vending, also add S3 and GCS\\ntoken support. Besides, we integrated this framework in Gravitino Iceberg REST catalog service. So\\nusers can smoothly access the Iceberg table on S3 and GCS with authentication.\\n\\nBut, this is just the first step of credential vending, we will add more integrations with Gravitino,\\nlike fileset support, connector support, etc, in the next release.\\n\\nFor the details of credential vending, please check the issue [#4398](https://github.com/apache/gravitino/issues/4398)\\nand the [design document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fovK0ylSmI45ynrCPcnRZqzyPDn7DRNb_ExdbjVPq0k/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.1cts6muko2j1).\\n\\n## Unified access control improvements\\n\\nIn Gravitino 0.6.0, we introduced the alpha version of unified access control with Apache Ranger\\nsupport ([here](https://gravitino.apache.org/blog/gravitino-0-6-0-release-notes#introducing-the-unified-rbac-model-for-gravitino)),\\nbut this feature still needs to improve a lot. In the version 0.7.0, we add lots of improvements\\nand fix bunches of bugs to make this access control end to end workable. Now, with the release of\\n0.7.0, the Gravitino unified access control can work well with Spark and Ranger to secure the table\\nfrom end to end. To see what we have fixed, please check out our issue [#4615](https://github.com/apache/gravitino/issues/4615).\\nYou can also try our [playground](https://github.com/apache/gravitino-playground) to experience the\\nunified access control feature.\\n\\n## Centralized audit log support\\n\\nThanks to the community, Gravitino now supports centralized audit log. With this feature enabled,\\nusers can get the audit log in the centralized place, no matter they\u2019re accessing tables or filesets from various sources.\\n\\nGravitino\u2019s audit log framework also supports to plugin different formatter and writer, so users\\ncan implement their own log format and output destinations.\\n\\nPlease see the issues [#4887](https://github.com/apache/gravitino/issues/4887)\\nand [#4021](https://github.com/apache/gravitino/issues/4021) to know more about Gravitino\u2019s\\ncentralized audit log.\\n\\n## New data sources support\\n\\nAs a unified data catalog, the community always pursue the target of adding more data sources. In\\nthis version, Gravitino adds two new data sources, one is [Apache Hudi](https://hudi.apache.org/),\\nanother is [OceanBase](https://github.com/oceanbase/oceanbase). You can now use Gravitino to\\nmanipulate Hudi and Oceanbase metadata in a unified manner.\\n\\n## Various core features\\n\\nApart from the features listed above, this version also improves a lot in its core, here lists several important features:\\n\\n* Add PostgreSQL support for storage backend [#4101](https://github.com/apache/gravitino/issues/4101).\\n  Gravitino already supports using MySQL, H2 as its backend metadata storage. In 0.7.0, the\\n  community adds the PostgreSQL support to enlarge its adoption.\\n* Unify the catalog and metalake drop behavior [#5031](https://github.com/apache/gravitino/issues/5031).\\n  In the previous version, we didn\u2019t enforce the behavior of catalog and metadata drop operation.\\n  In this version, we redefine its behavior and make it much safer to use.\\n* Manage the column in Gravitino [#4493](https://github.com/apache/gravitino/issues/4493).\\n  In 0.7.0, we introduce the column entity in Gravitino, and can be managed by Gravitino versionly.\\n  With this feature introduced, Gravitino now can support tagging on columns, and in future it\\n  can support column level operations.\\n* Add event listener for Iceberg REST catalog server [#5204](https://github.com/apache/gravitino/issues/5204)\\n  and support pre-event for event listener [#5112](https://github.com/apache/gravitino/issues/5112).\\n\\n## Other notable enhancements\\n\\n### Gravitino core\\n\\n* Supporting storing column metadata in Gravitino [#4493](https://github.com/apache/gravitino/issues/4493).\\n* Support pre-event for Gravitino [#5049](https://github.com/apache/gravitino/issues/5049).\\n* Unify drop metalake and catalog behavior [#5031](https://github.com/apache/gravitino/issues/5031).\\n* Add credential vending support in Gravitino [#4398](https://github.com/apache/gravitino/issues/4398).\\n* Support audit log in Gravitino [#4887](https://github.com/apache/gravitino/issues/4887).\\n* Shrink the package size of Gravitino [#4513](https://github.com/apache/gravitino/issues/4513).\\n\\n### Iceberg REST catalog server\\n\\n* Add credential vending for Iceberg REST server.

Keep reading to\\nlearn what the community has worked on and understand Gravitino\u2019s use cases.\\n\\n## Introducing the unified RBAC model for Gravitino\\n\\nAccess control is a crucial feature for the enterprise use of a data catalog, providing users with\\nunified and centralized authorization and authentication capabilities. This release introduces a\\nrole-based access control (RBAC) model in Gravitino to authorize different securable objects in a\\nunified manner.\\n\\nWe use `Privilege`, `SecurableObject`, `Role`, `User`, and `Group` to define the permissions.\\n\\n![RBAC model](./assets/rbac-img1.png)\\n\\n**Privilege**\\n\\nPrivilege defines the types of operations on different metadata objects, and is used to allow or\\ndeny a specific type of operation on a metadata object.\\n\\n**SecurableObject**\\n\\nSecurableObject binds multiple operation-specific types of privileges to a single metadata object.\\n\\n**Role**\\n\\nA Role is a collection of SecurableObjects, and a role represents multiple operation type\\npermissions on multiple metadata objects.\\n\\n**User**\\nUsers are granted one or multiple roles, and users have different operating privileges depending \\non their roles.\\n\\n**Group**\\n\\nTo make it easier to grant a single permission to multiple users, we can add users to a group,\\nand then grant one or more roles to that user group. This process allows all users belonging to\\nthat user group to have the permissions in those roles.\\n\\nMore importantly, the privileges authorized by the user in Gravitino will be pushed down to\\nthe underlying permission system. Currently, we support push permissions to Apache Ranger,\\nothers like IAM are under development.\\n\\n![Authorization flow](./assets/rbac-img2.png)\\n\\nFor more information about how our RBAC works, please check out our [design document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11MF1PTN5UTKJf3WLuHqhCikQzJoLxaXM_AEDZpXhO2I/edit?usp=sharing).\\nTo enable and use access control in Gravitino, please refer to the [user document](https://gravitino.apache.org/docs/0.6.0-incubating/security/access-control).\\n\\nOur implementation of unified access control capability is still in the alpha stage, and we\u2019re\\nstriving to add more features and make it stable as soon as possible, so please stay tuned.\\n\\n## Separation of the Iceberg REST catalog service\\n\\nApache Iceberg is a first-class citizen, and Gravitino has provided an embedded Iceberg REST catalog\\nservice since version 0.3. We have seen the increased demands and adoption of Iceberg REST catalog\\nservice as a standalone server. So, in version 0.6.0, we refactored the whole architecture and\\nmodularized the Iceberg REST catalog service as a standalone service, allowing it to be deployed\\nwith or without the Gravitino server. Besides the refactoring, we also bumped the supported version\\nto Iceberg 1.5.2, added support for S3 cloud storage, and now support the `registerTable` interface.\\n\\nIceberg REST catalog support is crucial to Gravitino, and modularization is just the first step.\\nIn future releases, we will add more features like cloud storage support and integrating Gravitino\u2019s\\nRBAC model, credential vending, etc.\\n\\nTo use the Gravitino Iceberg REST catalog service, please check our [user document](https://gravitino.apache.org/docs/0.6.0-incubating/iceberg-rest-service).\\nThe umbrella issue is [#4058](https://github.com/apache/gravitino/issues/4058).\\n\\n## Tagging support\\n\\nTagging on metadata objects is useful for data discovery, classification, and data governance.\\nIt can also be leveraged by query engines to provide tag-based access control. In Gravitino 0.6.0,\\nwe introduce tag support users can add tags on metadata objects like `CATALOG`, `SCHEMA`, `TABLE`,\\n`FILESET`, and `TOPIC`. To know how our tag system is designed, please check out the \\n[design document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zkQWla8OMIPY61HqKUivpf43cTteNvcd2w_oA32yAfg/edit#heading=h.26ac49mb3u1q)\\nand issue [#3344](https://github.com/apache/gravitino/issues/3344). To use \\ntags in both REST API and Java SDK, please see [how to manage tags](https://gravitino.apache.org/docs/0.6.0-incubating/manage-tags-in-gravitino).\\n\\n## Apache Flink Gravitino connector\\n\\nAs an open data catalog, we want to be able to support all query engines. Therefore, alongside Trino\\nand Apache Spark, we have added Apache Flink as our newest supported query engine.\\n\\nIn 0.6.0, we added a new Flink Gravitino connector [#1354](https://github.com/apache/gravitino/issues/1354)\\nand supported querying Hive tables using Flink with Gravitino. Hive support is just our first step,\\nwe will continue to add more table support.\\n\\nTo know how to use the Flink Gravitino connector, please refer to our [documentation](https://gravitino.apache.org/docs/0.6.0-incubating/flink-connector/flink-connector).\\n\\n## Apache Paimon table management in Gravitino\\n\\nApache Paimon has become quite popular this year, and many companies use Paimon to build their\\nstreaming warehouse or lakehouse. To manage all the lakehouse tables in a unified manner, Gravitino\\nhas added Paimon table management in 0.6.0 [#1129](https://github.com/apache/gravitino/issues/1129).\\nUsers can use our unified API to manage Paimon tables as well as other tables.\\nTo know more about how to manage Paimon tables, please refer to [Lakehouse Paimon Catalog document](https://gravitino.apache.org/docs/0.6.0-incubating/lakehouse-paimon-catalog).\\n\\n## Add Python GVFS support for fileset\\n\\nIn Gravitino 0.5, we added a Java Hadoop Compatible Filesystem (HCFS) support (GVFS) for fileset\\nread/write in Gravitino. The provided Java GVFS can be used by query engines like Apache Spark to\\nread/write data from files or folders. Although this works well in big data, AI development is\\nlargely dominated by Python, which can create an obstacle and hinder users from using Fileset with AI frameworks.\\n\\nIn 0.6.0, we followed the Python fsspec to provide a Python GVFS package that can be used by popular\\nPython frameworks like Apache Arrow, Pandas, Ray, LlamaIndex, and more. You can check \\nout [Python GVFS document](https://gravitino.apache.org/docs/0.6.0-incubating/how-to-use-gvfs#2-managing-files-of-fileset-with-python-gvfs) for more information.\\n\\n## Notable enhancements\\n\\n### Gravitino core\\n\\n* Support catalog reload after a property is altered [#2267](https://github.com/apache/gravitino/issues/2267).\\n* Deprecate KV store and add H2 support as embedded storage backend [#3968](https://github.com/apache/gravitino/issues/3968).\\n\\n### Catalog relate\\n\\n* Add API test catalog connection [#4107](https://github.com/apache/gravitino/issues/4107). \\n* Improve the type system to support unknown types [#3427](https://github.com/apache/gravitino/issues/3427). \\n* Add Kerberos support for fileset Hadoop catalog [#3462](https://github.com/apache/gravitino/issues/3462). \\n* Add S3 support for Iceberg [#4264](https://github.com/apache/gravitino/issues/4264). \\n* Support cloud and region property when creating catalog [#3966](https://github.com/apache/gravitino/issues/3966). \\n* Support multiple Kerberos authentication for Hive catalog [#3906](https://github.com/apache/gravitino/issues/3906). \\n* Unify the behavior of purge for all the catalogs [#3685](https://github.com/apache/gravitino/issues/3685).\\n\\n### API and client\\n\\n* Refactor Java and Python API for better user experience [#3626](https://github.com/apache/gravitino/issues/3626).\\n* Add missing error handlers in Python client [#4225](https://github.com/apache/gravitino/issues/4225).\\n\\nAll the resolved issues targeting the 0.6.0 release can be seen at https://github.com/apache/gravitino/issues?page=12&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+label%3A0.6.0.\\n\\n## Overall\\n\\nApache Gravitino 0.6.0 is the first ASF release, we would like to show appreciation to the Gravitino\\ncommunity for their continued support and valuable contributions.
